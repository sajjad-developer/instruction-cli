## Reporting a Vulnerability

We sincerely appreciate the efforts of security researchers and users who responsibly disclose vulnerabilities. Your contributions help us keep **instruction-cli** secure for everyone.

If you discover a security vulnerability within **instruction-cli**, please report it to us privately through GitHub's security advisory process. This is our preferred method, as it allows us to address the issue before public disclosure.

**How to Report:**

1. Navigate to the **Security** tab of our repository:  
   [https://github.com/sajjad-developer/instruction-cli/security](https://github.com/sajjad-developer/instruction-cli/security)

2. Click on the **"Report a vulnerability"** button (under "Private vulnerability reporting" or "Advisories").

3. Fill out the form with as much detail as possible, including:
   - A clear description of the vulnerability.
   - Steps to reproduce the vulnerability.
   - The affected version(s) of **instruction-cli**.
   - Any potential impact or exploit scenarios.
   - If possible, provide a proof-of-concept (PoC) or code snippet that demonstrates the vulnerability.

**Our Commitment:**

- **Acknowledgement:** We aim to acknowledge receipt of your report within **2 business days**.
- **Response:** We will provide a more detailed response, including an initial assessment and a timeline for remediation (if applicable), within **7 business days**.
- **Disclosure:** We kindly request that you do not disclose the vulnerability publicly until we have had a reasonable amount of time to investigate and address it. We will work with you to coordinate a public announcement once the issue is resolved.

Thank you for helping us maintain a secure project!
